# grunt-requirejs [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/asciidisco/grunt-requirejs.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/asciidisco/grunt-requirejs)

> Optimize [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) based projects

## Warning
This is a fork from the original repo [asciidisco/grunt-requirejs](https://github.com/asciidisco/grunt-requirejs). We changed the dependency version for requirejs from *2.1.x* to a more specified *2.1.9*. It seems there is an issue while optimizing js files in version *2.1.10*. We will try to figure it out whats happening and report this issue if it's an issue...

Do not use this repo for your own projects. We will remove this repo as soon as possible!
